# NYC Bikesharing Usage
## Overview of Analysis. Purpose of this project is to see if it would be feasible to replicate the NYC Citibike program in Des Moines, Iowa using Citibike data for 
   August 2019.
#Slide 1 Customer type. Over 80% of rides were by subscribers. This gives Citibike a solid base of core users and a more predictable cash flow.
#Slide 2 Rides sorted by gender. Males accounted for about 66% of all rides.
#Slide 3 Tripduration. Most rides are 20 minutes or less based on all rides.
#Slide 4 Tripduration by gender. When broken down by gender most rides are still less than 20 minutes.
#Slide 5 Trips by time of day. The heat map shows that rides seem to be clustered around rush hour. Based on this heat map it appears that there is a high percentage of users who use Citibike to commute for work and most of those trips are 20 minutes or less. Weekend usage seem to be more evenly distributed throughout the day.
3Slide 6 Trips by time of day and gender. Reinforces slide 5 findings. Reasults are similar across genders.
#Slide 7 Trips by day and customer type. Male subscribers are consistently heavy users each day. Customer trips are more evenly distributed across days and genders.
###Summary. The results show that the core users of the Citibike program are subscribers who appear to commute using Citibike for 20 minutes or less. Two other visualizations that might be helpful would be the profitability of subscribers vs customers. Another insight that would be helpful would be to see how many customers are tourists from out of town.
  Whether this type of program could be successful in Des Moines remains to be seen. Winters are more extreme and there is not the same degree of tourism. For the program to suceed there would need to be a core group of subscribers who have a need to rent a bike. For people in Des Moines it may be easier to just buy a bike.
New York apartments are notoriously small and storing a bike difficult. That may not be a problem in Des Moines. If they were to start a program I would start small and see if there was enough demand to make it viable.
